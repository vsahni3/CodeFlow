## Inspiration
All of us have gone through the painstaking and difficult process of onboarding as interns and making sense of huge repositories with many layers of folders and files. We hoped to shorten this or remove it completely through the use of Code Flow.

## What it does
Code Flow exists to speed up onboarding and make code easy to understand for non-technical people such as Project Managers and Business Analysts. Once the user has uploaded the repo, it has 2 main features. First, it can visualize the entire repo by showing how different folders and files are connected and providing a brief summary of each file and folder. It can also visualize a file by showing how the different functions are connected for a more technical user. The second feature is a specialized chatbot that allows you to ask questions about the entire project as a whole or even specific files. For example, "Which file do I need to change to implement this new feature?"
